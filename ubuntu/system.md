### how to change GNOME focus policy 

In ubuntu, the default focus policy of GNOME is "click to focus", which means 
a window become active you need to click on it, but I want to change it to 
"focus follows mouse", which means a window get focus by the mouse passing 
over it. So this will ease text copying and pasting.

    System->windows->select windows when the mouse moves over them
