That's no big deal, just my work logs for preventing me forgetting some stuff.

Some articles originally were written using muse about one year ago, then converted 
to html. You can read them at http://billie66.users.sourceforge.net/

Now, I move to github from sourceforge, and use markdown instead of muse, so I
need to rewrite all these files.
