### the key property

>React always unmounts and remounts components when its key changesâ€”that's the
purpose of that property, to help React maintain an "identity" of a
component. In particular, it's required when using React's CSS transitions,
because the only way to animate out one component and animate in another is
to have them be separate DOM nodes.
