That's no big deal, just my work logs for preventing me forgetting some stuff.

Some articles originally were written using muse about one year ago, then
converted to html. You can read them at http://billie66.users.sourceforge.net/.
It has been a long time since I updated it last time. Maybe there are some
errors, but I no longer maintain it.

Now, I move to github from sourceforge, and use markdown instead of muse, so I
need to rewrite all these files, meantime to correct some errors.
