Meteor is a unique framework designed to address some of the most persistent concerns you face building web applications. First of all, Meteor is a full-stack framework that provides the same JavaScript APIs on both the client and server. There's no context switching, so your development environment is consistent and seamless. Meteor's highly-evolved bootstrapping gives you all the benefits of Node and Mongo without the tedious configuration usually required for MEAN stack apps. The Meteor platform blurs the lines between Client and Server, so that you can think of your web applications as a single, consistent project instead of a collection of disconnected parts. The reactive template model automatically pushes updates when data changes for fluid user experience. Users enjoy instant updates while Meteor handles the behind-the-scenes work of synchronizing data and building new pages. Finally, Meteor provides many unique productivity features, like push-button bundling and deployment, an intuitive interactivity protocol, and Smart Packages that make it a snap to manage application features.

Meteor in Action teaches you full-stack web development using the Meteor platform. It starts with an overview of a Meteor application, revealing the unique nature of Meteor's end-to-end application model. You'll dive into the Blaze templating engine, discover Meteor's reactive datasources model, learn simple and advanced routing techniques, and practice managing users, permissions, and roles. You'll be guided through typical real world scenarios like managing file uploads, SEO, and localizing your application as you create your own packages to reuse functionality across projects. Lastly you will cover how to deploy Meteor on your own server and how to scale efficiently.
