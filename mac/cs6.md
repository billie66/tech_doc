* make an image with size 800*600

cs6 cann't open iphone images, search google, this problem is caused by cs6.

so, use the third party tool preview to fix it, first of all, open a
specific image with Preview, save the image with a new name, and delete the
original file.

secondly, open the image on cs6, crop and resize it, bigger than
800*600, and select the entire image, copy it to the clipboard.

finally, build a new file, the width is 800px, the height is 600px, paste the
selected image into the new file, save the file with png format.
