On Linux/Unix, you need to make the file executable in order to run it. You 
can either do this with your desktop's file manager or, at the command line, type:

    chmod u+x qt-sdk-linux-x86-opensource-2009.03.1.bin

You should now be able to execute the file as normal. You can do this from 
the command line by typing:

    ./qt-sdk-linux-x86-opensource-2009.03.1.bin
