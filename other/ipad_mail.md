The Mail app doesn't have a logout option.  You can hide an email account by
going into Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Then select the account that
you don't want other people to see and slide the switch next to Mail to off
(you may also want to turn mail Notes off so that they appear under Mail as
opposed to Notes, so that they will also be hidden) - you can then repeat this
for other email accounts that you want hidden . Then go into Settings >
General > Restrictions, enable restrictions, and switch off 'Allow
Changes' next to the mail icon. If you then go into the Mail app the
account(s) should no longer appear. To regain access to the account : turn
off the restriction and then turn mail back on in the Mail settings.
